  _This major update migrates all release pipelines (except macOS/iOS) to fastforge and completely overhauls the Linux build process.

### Migration to fastforge
- Migrated all release commands to fastforge for consistency and better management.
- Replaced legacy build scripts with fastforge commands for Windows, Linux, and Android.
- Android APK/AAB builds now utilize fastforge instead of raw commands.

### Linux Build Refactor
- Introduced `linux-release-docker` command.
- Updated `linux-release-appimage` with new post-build scripts.
- Implemented `Linux Install Deps` script:
  - Automatically prepares the environment (Ubuntu/WSL).
  - Clones Flutter SDK from GitHub (stable branch) instead of downloading the archive.
  - Checks out the specific Flutter version defined in `pubspec.yaml` using `Linux Flutter Sync`.
  - Installs required dependencies from `linux_deps.list`.
- Rewrote AppImage packaging:
  - Manually constructs the AppImage directory structure.
  - Injects a custom `AppRun` script.
  - Implements a self-contained portable data structure:
    - Creates `hiddify.appimage.home` directory alongside the AppImage.
    - Stores configuration and user data within this directory to keep the system clean.

### Dockerized Build System
- Added `linux-release-docker` for building Linux artifacts without a local Linux environment.
- Caches Flutter SDK and Pub packages via Docker volumes to speed up subsequent builds.
- Outputs artifacts to `dist_docker` directory on the host machine.

### Windows Improvements
- Updated `windows-release-zip` to include the `portable` environment variable for portable builds.

### Other Changes
- Added `linux_deps.list` to centralize dependency management.
- Added `linux-flutter-sync` to `linux-prepare` command.
- Introduced `LINUX_DEPS` variable to extract package list from `linux_deps.list`.
- Introduced `REQUIRED_VER` variable to extract Flutter version from `pubspec.yaml`.
- Added `linux-flutter-sync` command to ensure the installed Flutter version matches `pubspec.yaml`._

* - Update getDatabaseDirectory to support portable mode based on the `` env var. - Create 'hiddify_portable_data' in the app directory if running in portable mode. - Add 'checkDirectoryAccess' to verify read/write permissions for the portable data folder. - Fallback to the default system path if write access to the portable directory is denied. 

* - Add  environment variable to identify the Windows portable version - This variable is set during the 'windows-release-zip' build process. 

* On Linux, left-clicking the tray icon opens the context menu instead of triggering `onTrayIconMouseDown`. Added a "Dashboard" menu item as a workaround to allow users to open the app window. 

* - Ignore MSIX self-signed keys to prevent accidental commit of secrets - Add dist_docker directory (Docker build output) to ignored paths. 

* - Enable Linux artifact building without requiring a local Linux environment (e.g., WSL or native Ubuntu) - Designed to be executed via the 'linux-release-docker' command in the Makefile. 

* Add some comments. 

* Pin Flutter SDK version and register new icon asset - Explicitly define Flutter SDK version in pubspec.yaml for consistency. - Note: This version is critical as it is parsed by Makefile and Dockerfile to setup the build environment. - Add 'ic_launcher_border.png' to the assets list. 

* Created a dedicated list file for Linux dependencies and integrated it into both Dockerfile and Makefile. 

* Switched to C++17 to ensure better compatibility with modern libraries and potential future dependencies. 

* Add some comments. 

* Update AppImage configuration in make_config.yaml - Remove app_run_file parameter (AppRun is now injected post-build) - Fix icon path - Update AppRun: Add install_integration to setup icons and create local .desktop entry with correct Exec path - Ensure index.theme creation if missing. 

* Update deb configuration in make_config.yaml - Add comments for supported_mime_type parameter - Add user data cleanup script to postuninstall_scripts - Update postinstall_scripts to set StartupWMClass to app.hiddify.com and remove conflicting hiddify.desktop from .local. 

* We decided to remove RPM packaging for the following reasons: - Flutter officially supports Debian-based systems only. - Persistent issues with dependency linking. - High maintenance overhead (requires Fedora environment setup). - Successful builds do not guarantee runtime stability on Red Hat-based systems. 

* Update MSIX config in make_config.yaml - Complete the list of supported languages - Add commented-out parameters for self-signed certificate. 

* Update exe configuration in make_config.yaml - Update publisher_url from hiddify-next to hiddify-app - Fix app_icon.ico path - Complete list of setup locales - Remove redundant 'executable_name' and 'output_base_file_name' parameters. 

* Synchronizing main_prod.dart with main.dart. 

* Removing "distribute_options.yaml" because we are using "fastforge package" command and "distribute_options.yaml" is realated to "fastforge release" command.

  _Fix/reported issues_

* Small fix/ profile_parser_test file was updated based on the changes in 'ProfileParser' 

* Update/ Improved UI/UX and aligned it with the manual section of the 'Add Profile' modal. 

* Update/ using loadingState instead of (save, update, delete & isBusy). ProfileDetailsPage is now used only for editing. The profile_details_notifier was completely rewritten, and the logic for applying and saving changes has been greatly simplified. 

* Update/ using Material icons instead of FluentIcons. 

* Update/ UI improvment. 

* Delete profile_local_override.dart. 

* Small fix/ using Material Icons instead of Cupertino Icons. 

* Update, fix/ fixed 'Free' profiles not updating and made minor changes to align with AddProfileNotifier.addManual. 

* Update, fix/ using Material icons instead of FluentIcons. Fixed the bottom sheet not closing when showing profileDetails. 

* Update/ rename method and use url to upsert. 

* Update/ rename methods. 

* Small fix. 

* Update/ moved part of the deleteProfile logic to ProfileDataSource. replaced the abortConnection method with toggleConnection. 

* Update/ updated AddProfileNotifier methods. added a Tile for isAutoUpdateDisable and to display the auto-update status. made minor changes to the Add button logic. 

* Update/ prevented error display on HTTP request cancellation. removed commented-out code. separated profile addition methods (addClipboard, addManual). rewrote the add method based on profileRepository changes and removed the renaming logic. canceled the request when AddProfileNotifier is disposed. 

* Update/ added profileParser and removed httpClient from the profileRepository's input parameters, adding profileParser as the new input parameter. 

* Update/ removed the local-override logic that was previously added to watchActiveProfile for preserving userOverride. added renaming logic to the insert operation; if a name is duplicated, random numbers are appended to the end (using getByName) so the user can differentiate. added logic to check for a profile's existence before editing. to manage the active profile during deletion, the isActive parameter is received. If the profile being deleted is active, another profile is selected as active after its removal. 

* Update/ passing the profile object to connect and reconnect. 

* Update/ parameters of the connect and reconnect methods were changed for simplicity. Commented-out code was removed. applyConfigOption was rewritten to align with the profileOverride changes. 

* Refactor/ deleted methods include (getByName, addByUrl, updateContent, addByContent, updateSubscription, add, patch, fetch). upsertRemote: Handles both creation and updating of remote profiles from a single entry point. It checks for an existing profile via URL to prevent duplicates. addLocal: Allows for creating profiles directly from local string content. offlineUpdate: Enables offline modifications by re-parsing the profile with new content while preserving existing headers. validateConfig: The logic has been updated to correctly handle and apply configuration overrides, which were previously ignored. removed the 'http_client' dependency from the repository. This responsibility has been moved to the 'profile_parser' to better separate concerns. a previously public field has been made private. the 'setActive' and 'deleteById' methods have been formally defined in the abstract interface. 

* Refactor/ converts the static 'ProfileParser' into a service class with access to Riverpod's 'ref'. adds 'addRemote', 'addLocal', 'updateRemote', and 'offlineUpdate' methods using 'fpdart'. moves profile download logic from 'profile_repository' to 'ProfileParser' and rewrites it with 'fpdart'. adds error handling for user-cancelled downloads. reads 'useXrayCoreWhenPossible' directly from 'ref' instead of passing all settings. changes the 'parse' method's input to 'ProfileEntity', simplifying the return logic with 'profile.map'. updates the name parser hierarchy to use the link protocol as a fallback. adds logic to disable profile auto-updates via user override. 

* Remove/ move 'protocol' method from 'link_parsers' to 'profile_parser' 

* Update/ removed 'toEntry' and 'subInfoPatch' methods from 'ProfileEntity'. added 'toInsertEntry' and 'toUpdateEntry' methods and replaced 'map' with 'switch'. added 'userOverride' and 'populatedHeaders' to the 'toEntity' method and renamed 'testUrl' to 'profileOverride'. 

* Update/ renamed 'testUrl' to 'profileOverride'. added a default value of 'Duration.zero' to 'updateInterval'. add/ added 'userOverride' and 'populatedHeaders' to the remote and local models. added a 'UserOverride' model with a version structure to ensure backward compatibility in the future. added isAutoUpdateDisable with default(false) to 'userOverride' 

* Update/ changes to 'ConfigOptionRepository' class: made 'getConfigOptions' private. renamed method 'getFullSingboxConfigOption' to 'fullOptions'. added method 'fullOptionsOverrided', which applies 'profileOverride' to the 'config options' before they're sent. improved error handling with 'fpdart'. 

* Update/ add 'ConfigOptionFailure' to 'ProfileFailure.invalidConfig' parameters to easily convert 'ConfigOptionFailure' to 'ProfileFailure'. add 'cancelByUser' for when an HTTP request is cancelled by the user(this helps to distinguish the error and prevent its display) 

* Update/ add 'ConfigOptionFailure' to 'ConnectionFailure.invalidConfigOption' parameters to easily convert 'ConfigOptionFailure' to 'ConnectionFailure' 

* Update/ schema_v5 test file(auto generated by drift_dev) 

* Delete/ old drift test files.
